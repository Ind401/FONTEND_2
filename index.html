        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Need of Education reform</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development.
             While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. 
             Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

            We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
            
            For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Subjects like financial technologies or biotechnology or behavioural economics, all are major upcoming fields from different subject specializations.

        A shift from the theoretical framework to a practical framework will certainly help the cause.
        
        I do understand that in a country as big and diverse as ours it is surely “easier said than done” but it surely should be on the top of the government bucket list.
        
        Small steps can be taken if the whole “revolution” seems unfeasible. Sports and Yoga too are great ideas that very well should be incorporated in the school curriculum and the govt is doing good on this

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Lastly, education as rightly is incomplete with the right value sets… 
            somewhat a spirit of coordination should prevail over competition among students today which largely seems missing… 
            a rat race for marks only highlights the state of education as on now…
